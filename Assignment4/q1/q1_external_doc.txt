This version_buddy.sh is the script to change the name from ‘_’ to ‘.’

Firstly, I made then errorMessage like the example text log’s, and I divided name, major, minor, and ext. Then I checked user input.

If user input number is not 1, output the errorMessage.
If user input contains “-v” option, output the errorMessage.
If user input is the file name that has already in the project, output the errorMessage.
If user input is a direction, output the errorMessage

Then, I was trying to check user input’s specific, if name not only contains letter, number and ‘-‘, output thn errorMessage

If major is not only contains 1-2 digits number, output the errorMessage
If the minor is not only in 1-2 digits number, output the errorMessage
If the ext is not fine, output the errorMessage
If everything is fine, but the file is not exist, output the errorMessage
If everything is fine from all above, using the mv to change the file name

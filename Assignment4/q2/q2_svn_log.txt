I think I do not need .sh for ext, because everything in linux is a file, and also I have aready defined this is a shell script in the file, so I think it will be work to display in svn server

I did the wrong thing, becasue I separate the file to 2 files, and when I checked the e-mail, the teacher said we have to do only one file, so this is should not be the final version of my file, so I decide delete all the previous file I upload, and I am going to make them together and reupload the file.

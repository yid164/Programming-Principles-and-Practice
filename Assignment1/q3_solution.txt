1.
In the q3_initial.cc, 8 line, the comment:// space for floating-point value is wrong, because it show be a char pointer

2.
We we use the if condition statement to check if we have enough arguments, we only write the 1 condition that “argc <3”, but the q3_initial.cc doesn’t gives any “else” statement.

3.
I changed the name int o to int outPut, int npvle to int inPutValue, and char *copyp to char copyPtr.
